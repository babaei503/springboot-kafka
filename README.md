2. kafka-consumer

## kafka-producer Microservice:

A producer is a piece of software that produces random scheduled events or 
manual events by calling http://localhost:8080/create-teacher REST endpoint. 
The producer sends those events to the Kafka server. The messages read by a 
consumer.

## kafka-consumer Microservice:

A consumer is a piece of software that receives events from Kafka.
